# calcWordAvg-LoanCalc
Two programs

**Write a C program named calcWordAvg.c that calculates the average word length for a sentence:
Enter a sentence : It was deja vu all over again.

Average word length : 3.4

For simplicity, your program should consider a punctuation mark to be part of the word to which it is attached. Display the average word length to one decimal place.

**Write a C program named loanCalc.c that calculates monthly payment and print a table of payment schedule for a fixed rate loan, which performs a similar task as in the link below:

In this C program, the input and output are defined as following:

 Input: amount of loan, interest rate per year and number of payments
 
Output: a table of amortization schedule (also called payment schedule) containing payment number, monthly payment, principal paid, interest paid and new balance at each row.
